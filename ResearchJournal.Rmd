# Research journal

Going forward, we will require research journals that will include your notes on how you found what you found, including links and other notes. 

This notebook is being created after the fact.

I knew about ADT counts from previous reporting, so I went looking for them on [the Nebraska DOT website](https://dot.nebraska.gov/). Through a press release, we found previous data, and later got the data we used [here](https://dot.nebraska.gov/media/113515/4-22-2020-traffic-count-dashboard.pdf). In that same press release is the announcement of a [data dashboard](https://gis.ne.gov/portal/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4473552a18f34645ad0dede3ae1105ce), which is useful for broad information but little else. 

With the PDF url from the press release, we then set about parsing the data into useful data. See the Data Journal in the raw-data folder for that information.
